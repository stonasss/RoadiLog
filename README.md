# RoadiLog

RoadiLog intends to serve the musician. The platform allows the artist to post any thoughts, recommendations, opinions and/or updates, to sell their merch, show off bands and/or projects they're participating in and, last but not least, to share snippets of any work in progress. Any artist interested in RoadiLog will be allowed to, overall, share a facet of themselves, be it sneak peaks, glimpses, or the whole stage.
