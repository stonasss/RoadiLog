# RoadiLog

RoadiLog intends to serve the musician. The platform allows the artist to post any thoughts, recommendations, opinions and/or updates, to inform their instrument(s) of choice, bands and/or projects they're participating in and, last but not least, to share snippets of any work in progress. Any artist interested in RoadiLog will be allowed to, overall, share a facet of themselves, be it sneak peaks, glimpses or the bigger picture.

This application is built using technologies such as Vite, TypeScript and TailwindCSS.
